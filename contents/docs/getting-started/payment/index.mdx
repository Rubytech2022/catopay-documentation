description: Welcome to the updated Catopay Payment API documentation. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate Catopay's payment services into your application.
---
### Payment (Updated)

This guide will help you integrate Catopay's payment API into your application, allowing you to create payment requests, handle responses, and manage payment processes effectively.

---

### 1. Prepare Your Catopay API Key

First, generate your API key from the Catopay Dashboard:

- Log in to your Catopay Dashboard.
- Go to the **API Keys** tab.
- Click **Generate** to create an API key.
- Use this API key for authentication in all API requests.

---

### 2. Fetch All Payment Methods

Before creating a payment request, fetch the available payment methods using a GET request.

**Endpoint:**  
`GET https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods`

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods", {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace APIKEY with your actual API key
    }
});
console.log(response.data);  // List of available payment methods
```

---

### 3. Create a Payment Request

Use this POST request to create a payment. You can include an optional `note` and pass suggested numbers that will show up on the transaction submission page.

**Endpoint:**  
`POST https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/create`

**Request Payload:**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/create", {
    amount: 100,  // Amount to be charged
    description: "Payment for services",  // Description of the transaction
    redirect_url: "https://your-domain/payment_endpoint",  // Your custom redirect URL
    callback_url: "__your__callback__endpoint__",  // Your server's callback URL
    paymentMethodId: "__select__from__fetched__payment__methods__",  // ID from fetched methods
    note: "This is a custom note for the payment",  // Optional custom note

}, {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": "__your__api__key__"  // Replace with your actual API key
    }
});

console.log(response.data);  // Response includes the payment_url
```

---

### 4. Redirect User to Payment URL

Once the payment request is created, the response will include a `payment_url`. Redirect the user to this URL to complete the payment.

**Updated Flexibility for Suggested Numbers:**
- You can provide one or more suggested numbers using the `numbers` parameter in the request.
- These numbers will be displayed on the transaction submission page, and the user can select one.
- If you don't provide any numbers, the user will see an empty field where they can manually enter a number.

**Example Redirect:**
```javascript
window.location.href = response.data.payment_url;  // Redirect to the payment page
```

---

### 5. Handle Redirect and Callback URLs

After the payment is processed:

- **Redirect to `redirect_url`**: Once the user submits their payment, they will be redirected to your `redirect_url`.
- **Server-to-Server Callback to `callback_url`**: After confirming the transaction, Catopay will call your provided callback URL with two additional parameters:
  - `transactionId`: The unique identifier for the transaction.
  - `status`: The status of the transaction (e.g., success, pending, failed).

**Updated Callback Example:**

Catopay will append the following parameters to your callback URL:
```
callback_url + `?transactionId=${transactionId}&status=${status}`
```

**Example Callback URL:**
```
https://your-server.com/payment_callback?transactionId=12345&status=success
```

You can also add any custom parameters to your callback URL based on your application's needs. Catopay will only append the `transactionId` and `status` parameters.

---

### Key Points

- Keep your **API key** secure.
- If you use `numbers`, they will be shown on the transaction page, allowing users to choose from them or enter a number manually if not provided.
- The `callback_url` can include any custom parameters, but Catopay will add `transactionId` and `status` to it.
