description: Welcome to the updated Catopay Payment API documentation. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate Catopay's payment services into your application.
---

### 1. Prepare Your Catopay API Key

Generate your API key from the Catopay Dashboard:

- Log in to your Catopay Dashboard.
- Navigate to the **Settings** page.
- Copy your API key for all API requests, including payment creation, retrieval, and callback handling.

---

### 2. Fetch Payment Methods

Before creating a payment request, retrieve the available payment methods using the following GET request.

**Endpoint:**  
`GET https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods`

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods", {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace APIKEY with your actual API key
    }
});
console.log(response.data);  // List of available payment methods
```

---

### 3. Create a Payment Request

Use the following POST request to create a payment, including optional numbers for transaction submission.

**Endpoint:**  
`POST https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/create`

**Request Payload:**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/create", {
    amount: 100,  // Amount to be charged
    description: "Payment for services",  // Description of the transaction
    redirect_url: "https://your-domain/payment_endpoint",  // Your custom redirect URL
    callback_url: "__your__callback__endpoint__",  // Your server's callback URL
    paymentMethodId: "__select__from__fetched__payment__methods__",  // Payment method ID
    numbers: "1234567890,0987654321"  // Comma-separated numbers for transaction page (optional)
}, {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": "__your__api__key__"  // Replace with your actual API key
    }
});

console.log(response.data);  // Response will include the payment URL
```

---

### 4. Redirect User to Payment URL

Once the payment request is created, the response will include a `payment_url`. Redirect the user to this URL to complete the payment.

- You can provide numbers in the `numbers` parameter, which will appear on the transaction submission page.
- If no numbers are provided, the user will see an empty field for manual input.

**Example Redirect:**
```javascript
window.location.href = response.data.payment_url;  // Redirect to the payment page
```

---

### 5. Handle Redirect and Retrieve Payment Information

After payment processing, the user will be redirected to your specified `redirect_url`. The **transaction ID** will be appended to the redirect URL, but **no status** will be included. 

You must retrieve the payment details using the following endpoint before using any information like the status.

**Retrieve Payment Details Endpoint:**  
`GET http://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/retrieve/:transactionId`

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const transactionId = "66f7b981f3f5e1fa9dd364c1";  // Replace with the actual transaction ID

const response = await axios.get(`http://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/retrieve/${transactionId}`, {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace with your actual API key
    }
});

console.log(response.data);  // Contains the payment details, including status
```

---

### 6. Handle Callback URL and Retrieve Payment Information

After the payment is processed, Catopay will send a callback to your `callback_url`, including the following parameters:

- `transactionId`: Unique identifier for the transaction.
- `status`: Current status of the transaction.

Even though the status is provided in the callback, **you must retrieve the payment information** from the `/payment/retrieve/:transactionId` endpoint to ensure data integrity before using it.

**Example Callback Handling:**
```javascript
app.post('/payment_callback', async (req, res) => {
    const { transactionId, status } = req.query;

    // Retrieve the payment details to confirm the status
    const paymentDetails = await axios.get(`http://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/retrieve/${transactionId}`, {
        headers: {
            "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace with your actual API key
        }
    });

    // Double-check the payment status
    const actualStatus = paymentDetails.data.data.status;

    // Take action based on the actual status
    if (actualStatus === 'Completed') {
        // Handle successful payment
    } else if (actualStatus === 'Failed') {
        // Handle failed payment
    }

    res.status(200).send('Callback received');
});
```

### Key Points

- **Keep your API key secure**: Never expose your API key publicly.
- **Retrieve Payment Information**: Always retrieve payment information using the `transactionId` before relying on any status from redirects or callbacks.
- **Numbers Parameter**: If you use the `numbers` field, they will appear on the transaction page for users to select or enter manually if no numbers are provided.
- **Double-Check Status**: Even if the callback provides a status, always confirm it by fetching the payment details to avoid potential fraud or manipulation.
- **Callback URL Customization**: The `callback_url` can include custom parameters, but Catopay will add `transactionId` and `status` to it for security.
- **Server-Side API Calls**: Always make API calls from your server. Avoid using client-side code (like in the browser or mobile app) for API requests, as this can expose sensitive information, including your API key and wallet secrets.
