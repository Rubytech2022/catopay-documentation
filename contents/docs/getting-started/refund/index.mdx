description: This guide helps you create a refund request using Catopay's refund API. Follow these steps to fetch payment methods and initiate a refund, including cases where the wallet requires additional security.

### 1. Prepare Your Catopay API Key

Generate your API key from the Catopay Dashboard:

- Log in to your Catopay Dashboard.
- Navigate to the **Settings** page.
- Copy your API key for all API requests.
- Handle Callback URL and Retrieve Refund Information
---

### 2. Fetch Payment Methods

Before creating a refund request, you need to retrieve the available payment methods using the following GET request.

**Endpoint:**  
`GET https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods`

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const response = await axios.get(
  "https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods",
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": APIKEY, // Replace APIKEY with your actual API key
    },
  }
);
console.log(response.data); // List of available payment methods
```

---

### 3. Create a Refund Request

Use the following POST request to create a refund. There are two cases to handle:

- **Without Wallet Secret**: The default process.
- **With Wallet Secret**: If the user's wallet has Secret enabled, you must include the `walletSecret` field in the payload.

**Endpoint:**  
`POST https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/refund/create-a-request`

#### Case 1: Without Wallet Secret

For users who do not have a wallet secret enabled, use the following payload.

**Request Payload:**

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/refund/create-a-request",
  {
    amount: 99, // Refund amount
    paymentMethodId: "668ec9848872303a38e59907", // Retrieved payment method ID
    refundReason: "Product defect", // Reason for refund
    accountType: "PERSONAL_ACCOUNT", // Account type: PERSONAL_ACCOUNT, BUSINESS_ACCOUNT, etc.
    bankNumberOrAddress: "1234567890", // Bank account number or address
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "__your__api__key__", // Replace with your actual API key
    },
  }
);

console.log(response.data); // Response will confirm refund creation
```

#### Case 2: With Wallet Secret
Same as Case 1 but only add `walletSecret` in the payload.

### 4. Handle Callback URL and Retrieve Refund Information

After the refund is processed, Catopay will send a callback to your `callback_url`, including the following parameters:

- `transactionId`: Unique identifier for the transaction.
- `status`: Current status of the transaction.

Even though the status is provided in the callback, **you must retrieve the refund information** from the `/refund/retrieve/:transactionId` endpoint to ensure data integrity before using it.

**Example Callback Handling:**
```javascript
app.post('/refund_callback', async (req, res) => {
    const { transactionId, status } = req.query;

    // Retrieve the refund details to confirm the status
    const refundDetails = await axios.get(`http://api.catopay.com/api/v1/refund/retrieve/${transactionId}`, {
        headers: {
            "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace with your actual API key
        }
    });

    // Double-check the payment status
    const actualStatus = refundDetails.data.data.status;

    // Take action based on the actual status
    if (actualStatus === 'Completed') {
        // Handle successful payment
    } else if (actualStatus === 'Failed') {
        // Handle failed payment
    }

    res.status(200).send('Callback received');
});
```

### Key Points

- **Keep your API key secure**: Never expose your API key publicly.
- **Wallet Secret**: If your wallet has Secret enabled, you must pass the `walletSecret` field in the refund request.
- **Double-Check Payment Method**: Ensure the `paymentMethodId` is retrieved correctly from the payment methods endpoint before using it in the refund request.
- **Server-Side API Calls**: Always make API calls from your server. Avoid using client-side code (like in the browser or mobile app) for API requests, as this can expose sensitive information, including your API key and wallet secrets.
