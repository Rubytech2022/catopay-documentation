### 1. Prepare Your Catopay API Key

To use the refund API, generate an API key from the Catopay Dashboard:

- Log in to your Catopay Dashboard.
- Navigate to the **API Keys** tab.
- Click **Generate** to create your API key.
- Use this API key for all API requests, including fetching payment methods and creating refunds.

---

### 2. Fetch Payment Methods

Before creating a refund, you must fetch the available payment methods to get the `paymentMethodId` needed for the refund request.

**Endpoint:**  
`GET https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods`

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/payment/methods", {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace APIKEY with your actual API key
    }
});
console.log(response.data);  // List of available payment methods
```

Use the `paymentMethodId` from the response in your refund request.

---

### 3. Create a Refund Request

Once you have the `paymentMethodId`, use the following POST request to initiate a refund.

**Endpoint:**  
`POST https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/refund/create`

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
    "amount": 99,  // Amount to refund
    "paymentMethodId": "668ec9848872303a38e59907",  // ID of the payment method (from the previous step)
    "refundReason": "Product defect",  // Reason for the refund
    "accountType": "PERSONAL_ACCOUNT",  // Account type (choose from PERSONAL_ACCOUNT, BUSINESS_ACCOUNT, AGENT_ACCOUNT, MERCHANT_ACCOUNT)
    "bankNumberOrAddress": "1234567890"  // Bank number or address for refund
}
```

**Sample Code (Using Axios):**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post("https://api.catopay.com/api/v1/refund/create", {
    amount: 99,  // Amount to refund
    paymentMethodId: "668ec9848872303a38e59907",  // ID of the payment method
    refundReason: "Product defect",  // Reason for the refund
    accountType: "PERSONAL_ACCOUNT",  // Account type (PERSONAL_ACCOUNT, BUSINESS_ACCOUNT, AGENT_ACCOUNT, MERCHANT_ACCOUNT)
    bankNumberOrAddress: "1234567890"  // Bank number or address for refund
}, {
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": APIKEY  // Replace with your actual API key
    }
});

console.log(response.data);  // Response will contain refund status and details
```

### Key Points

- **API Key**: Pass the API key in the request header as `"x-api-key"`.
- **Payment Method**: Fetch the payment methods first and use the `paymentMethodId` from the response in the refund request.
- **Account Types**: Specify the correct account type in the `accountType` field. Valid options are `PERSONAL_ACCOUNT`, `BUSINESS_ACCOUNT`, `AGENT_ACCOUNT`, and `MERCHANT_ACCOUNT`.
- **Refund Reason**: Always provide a valid reason for the refund in the `refundReason` field.
